# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
# following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.

## @x: a square invertible matrix
        ## return: a list containing functions to
        ##              1. set the matrix
        ##              2. get the matrix
        ##              3. set the inverse
        ##              4. get the inverse
        ##         this list is used as the input to cacheSolve()
